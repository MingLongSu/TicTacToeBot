# ü§ñ TicTacToeBot

Discord bot built using Discod's bot API and Python3

As we sit idly by waiting for the COVID-19 quarantine to come to an end, we can't help but reminisce on the times before the quarantine; when the world was still "normal."
We even think back as far as the kindergarten days, playing typical games like Tic Tac Toe or checkers with friends, but again, you're reminded of how you're now separated from
your friends and family members.

As a result, to make use of the currently virtual world, and the sheer popularity of Discord which helps to keep us connected with our friends and family, this project was 
created. The aim of the Tic Tac Toe bot is to provide Discord users in a server the wholesome experience of playing Tic Tac Toe with friends like they once used to many years ago.

## ‚ùå Features
- Tic Tac Toe AI to provide Discord users a challenge or foe to play against when friends are busy
- Implemented a user-selected emoji-based Tic Tac Toe game to diverge away from the common X and O games
- Added a set_ttt_channel command to ensure Tic Tac Toe games did not hinder conversation channels in a server
- Established a request-based system for asking to play against others
- Incorporated a queue system to help users organise their flood of game requests

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Plans
- Publish bot to allow users to simply import the bot into their servers as opposed to providing the source code fully
- Fix issue with minimax algorithm that occurs given a particular set of plays
