# TicTacToeBot

To use this bot most effectively, the OAuth2 settings must have the scope be set to 'bot' and then have the following text permissions: 'send messages' and 'manage messages.'
The algorithm that was learnt to be applied in this bot is thanks to GeeksForGeeks' article on the minimax algorithm.
